WeasyPrint changelog
====================

Version 0.13
------------

Released on 2012-07-23.

* Add support for PyGTK, as an alternative to PyGObject + introspection.
  This should make WeasyPrint easier to run on platforms that not not have
  packages for PyGObject 3.x yet.
* Bug fix: crash in PDF outlines for some malformed HTML documents


Version 0.12
------------

Released on 2012-07-19.

* Add support for collapsed borders on tables. This is currently incompatible
  with repeating header and footer row groups on each page: headers and footers
  are treated as normal row groups on table with ``border-collapse: collapse``.
* Add ``url_fetcher`` to the public API. This enables users to hook into
  WeasyPrint for fetching linked stylesheets or images, eg. to generate them
  on the fly without going through the network.
  This enables the creation of `Flask-WeasyPrint
  <http://packages.python.org/Flask-WeasyPrint/>`.


Version 0.11
------------

Released on 2012-07-04.

* Add support for floats and clear.
  Together with various bug fixes, this enables WeasyPrint to pass the Acid2
  test! Acid2 is now part of our automated test suite.
* Add support for the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height and
  max-height properties in @page. The size property is now the size of the
  page’s containing block.
* Switch the Variable Dimension rules to the new proposal:
  https://github.com/SimonSapin/css/blob/master/margin-boxes-variable-dimension
  The previous implementation was broken in many cases.
* The ``image-rendering``, ``transform``, ``transform-origin`` and ``size``
  properties are now unprefixed. The prefixed form (eg. -weasy-size) is ignored
  but gives a specific warning.


Version 0.10
------------

Released on 2012-06-25.

* Add ``get_png_pages()`` to the public API. It returns each page as
  a separate PNG image.
* Add a ``resolution`` parameter for PNG.
* Add *WeasyPrint Navigator*, a web application that shows WeasyPrint’s
  output with clickable links. Yes, that’s a browser in your browser.
  Start it with ``python -m weasyprint.navigator``
* Add support for `vertical-align: top` and `vertical-align: bottom`
* Add support for `page-break-before: avoid` and `page-break-after: avoid`
* Bug fixes


Version 0.9
-----------

Released on 2012-06-04.

* Relative, absolute and fixed positioning
* Proper painting order (z-index)
* In PDF: support for internal and external hyperlinks as well as bookmarks.
* Added the ``tree`` parameter to the ``HTML`` class: accepts a parsed lxml
  object.
* Bug fixes, including many crashes.

Bookmarks can be controlled by the ``-weasy-bookmark-level`` and
``-weasy-bookmark-label`` properties, as described in `CSS Generated Content
for Paged Media Module <http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-gcpm/#bookmarks>`_.

The default UA stylesheet sets a matching bookmark level on all ``<h1>``
to ``<h6>`` elements.


Version 0.8
-----------

Released on 2012-05-07.

* Switch from cssutils to tinycss_ as the CSS parser.
* Switch to the new cssselect_, almost all level 3 selectors are supported now.
* Support for inline blocks and inline tables
* Automatic table layout (column widths)
* Support for the ``min-width``, ``max-width``, ``min-height`` and
  ``max-height`` properties, except on table-related and page-related boxes.
* Speed improvements on big stylesheets / small documents thanks to tinycss.
* Many bug fixes

* *Backward incompatible*: completely change the Python API.
  See the documentation: http://weasyprint.org/using/#as-a-python-library

  This changes how blocks are rendered: adjoining margins "collapse"
  (their maximum is used) instead of accumulating.

* Switch to pystacia instead of PIL for raster images
* Add compatibility with CPython 2.6 and 3.2. (Previously only 2.7
  was supported)

-----------

Released on 2012-02-08.

* Support for the ``overflow`` and ``clip`` properties.
* Support for the ``opacity`` property from CSS3 Colors.
* Support for CSS 2D Transforms. These are prefixed, so you need to use
  ``-weasy-transform`` and ``-weasy-transform-origin``.


Version 0.4
-----------

Released on 2012-02-07.

* Support ``text-align: justify``, ``word-spacing`` and ``letter-spacing``.
* Partial support for CSS3 Paged Media: page size and margin boxes with
  page-based counters.
* All CSS 2.1 border styles
* Fix SVG images with non-pixel units. Requires CairoSVG 0.3
* Support for ``page-break-before`` and ``page-break-after``, except for
  the value ``avoid``.
* Support for the ``background-clip``, ``background-origin`` and
  ``background-size`` from CSS3 (but still with a single background
  per element)
* Support for the ``image-rendering`` from SVG. This one is prefixed,
  use ``-weasy-image-rendering``. It only has an effect on PNG output.

Released on 2011-12-14.

Compatibility with CairoSVG 0.1.2


Version 0.3
-----------

Released on 2011-12-13.

* **Backward-incompatible change:** the 'size' property is now prefixed (since
  it is in an experimental specification). Use '-weasy-size' instead.
* cssutils 0.9.8 or higher is now required.
* Support SVG images with CairoSVG
* Support generated content: the ``:before`` and ``:after`` pseudo-elements,
  the ``content``, ``quotes`` and ``counter-*`` properties.
* Support ordered lists: all CSS 2.1 values of the ``list-style-type`` property.
* New user-agent stylesheet with HTML 5 elements and automatic quotes for many
  languages. Thanks Peter Moulder!
* Disable cssutils validation warnings, they are redundant with WeasyPrint’s.

* Various bug fixes


Version 0.2
-----------

Released on 2011-11-25.

* Support for tables.

  interpreted as text-top and text-bottom.

Tables have some limitations:
Only the fixed layout and separate border model are supported.
There are also no page break inside tables so a table higher
than a page will overflow.


Version 0.1
-----------

Released on 2011-10-28.

First packaged release. Supports "simple" CSS 2.1 pages: there is no
support for floats, tables, or absolute positioning. Other than that
most of CSS 2.1 is supported, as well as CSS 3 Colors and Selectors.
