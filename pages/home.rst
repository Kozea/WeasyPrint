WeasyPrint converts HTML/CSS documents to PDF
=============================================

WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS that can export
to PDF. It aims to support web standards for printing.
WeasyPrint is free software made available under the `BSD license
<https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.

It is based on various libraries but **not** on a full rendering engine like
WebKit or Gecko. The CSS layout engine is written in Python and meant to be
easy to hack on.

Sample output
-------------

As an example, here is the `introduction chapter
<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html>`_ of the CSS 2.1 spec
rendered with WeasyPrint:
`CSS21-intro.pdf </samples/CSS21-intro.pdf>`_. It was obtained by running::

    weasyprint http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html CSS21-intro.pdf -s http://weasyprint.org/samples/CSS21-print.css

Here is an extract of `CSS21-print.css`_:

.. code-block:: css

    @page {
        margin: 3cm 2cm; padding-left: 1.5cm;
        @top-center {
            content: "Introduction to CSS 2.1";
            vertical-align: bottom; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid }
        @bottom-right {
            content: "Page " counter(page) " of " counter(pages) }
        @left-top {
            content: "W3C Recommendation";
            background: #005a9c; color: #fff; text-align: right;
            transform-origin: 100% 0; transform: rotate(-90deg) }}
    body { text-align: justify }
    h1 { -weasy-bookmark-level: none }

Acid2
-----

Starting with version 0.11, WeasyPrint passes the Acid2_ test. This test
was published by the `Web Standards Project`_ as a challenge for web browser
to get better support for the HTML, CSS and PNG standards. It is made of
many small elements with various positioning techniques. When all the layout
rules are implemented correctly, they should add up to the smiling face
shown on the right.

.. _Web Standards Project: http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/

Have a look at WeasyPrint’s output `in PDF </samples/acid2.pdf>`_ and
`in PNG </samples/acid2.png>`_. The PNG is pixel-perfect, but with PDF
you may see faint lines or a moiré_ pattern inside the smiling head.
This is because the test is made for pixel-based screens with many layers
of different colors that overlap exactly. Only the top layers are supposed
to be visible but due to the way that most PDF viewers use anti-aliasing,
the bottom layers may bleed on the sides.
