Why WeasyPrint?
---------------

Automatic document generation is a common need of many applications, even if a
lot of operations do not require printed paper anymore.

Invoices, tickets, leaflets, diplomas, documentation, books… All these
documents are read and used on paper, but also on electronical readers, on
smartphones, on computers. PDF is a great format to store and display them in
a reliable way, with pagination.

Using HTML and CSS to generate static and paged content can be strange at first
glance: browsers display only one page, with variable dimensions, often in a
very dynamic way. But paged media layout is actually included in CSS2_, which
was already a W3C recommendation in 1998.

Other well-known tools can be used to automatically generate PDF documents,
like LaTeX and LibreOffice, but they miss many advantages that HTML and CSS
offer. HTML and CSS are very widely known, by developers but also by
webdesigners. They are specified in a backwards-compatible way, and regularly
adapted to please the use of billions of people. They are really easy to write
and generate, with a ridiculous amount of tools that are finely adapted to the
needs and taste of their users.

However, the web engines that are used for browsers were very limited for
pagination when WeasyPrint was created in 2011. Even now, they lack a lot of
basic features. That’s why projects such as wkhtmltopdf_ and PagedJS_ have been
created: they add some of these features to existing browsers.

Other solutions have beed developed, including web engine dedicated to paged
media. Prince_, Antennahouse_ or `Typeset.sh`_ created original renderers
supporting many features related to pagination. These tools are very powerful,
but they are not open source.

Building a free and open source web renderer generating high-quality documents
is the main goal of WeasyPrint. Do you think that it was a little bit crazy to
create such a big project from scratch? Here is what `Simon Sapin`_ wrote
in WeasyPrint’s documentation one month after the beginning:

  Are we crazy? Yes. But not that much. Each modern web browser did take many
  developers’ many years of work to get where they are now, but WeasyPrint’s
  scope is much smaller: there is no user-interaction, no JavaScript, no live
  rendering (the document doesn’t changed after it was first parsed) and no
  quirks mode (we don’t need to support every broken page of the web.)

  We still need however to implement the whole CSS box model and visual
  rendering. This is a lot of work, but we feel we can get something useful
  much quicker than “Let’s build a rendering engine!” may seem.

Simon is often right.

Why Python?
-----------

Python is a really good language to design a small, OS-agnostic parser. As it
is object-oriented, it gives the possibility to follow the specification with
high-level classes and a small amount of very simple code.

Speed is not WeasyPrint’s main goal. Web rendering is a very complex task, and
following :pep:`the Zen of Python <20>` helped a lot to keep our sanity (both in our
code and in our heads): code simplicity, maintainability and flexibility are
the most important goals for this library, as they give the ability to stay
really close to the specification and to fix bugs easily.


Dive into the Source
--------------------

This chapter is a high-level overview of WeasyPrint’s source code. For more
details, see the various docstrings or even the code itself. When in doubt,
feel free to :ref:`ask <Support>`!

Much `like in web browsers`_, the rendering of a document in WeasyPrint goes
like this:

1. The HTML document is fetched and parsed into a tree of elements (like DOM).
2. CSS stylesheets (either found in the HTML or supplied by the user) are
   fetched and parsed.
3. The stylesheets are applied to the DOM-like tree.
4. The DOM-like tree with styles is transformed into a *formatting structure*
   made of rectangular boxes.
5. These boxes are *laid-out* with fixed dimensions and position onto pages.
6. For each page, the boxes are re-ordered to observe stacking rules, and are
   drawn on a PDF page.
7. Metadata −such as document information, attachments, embedded files,
   hyperlinks, and PDF trim and bleed boxes− are added to the PDF.

Parsing HTML
............

Not much to see here. The :class:`HTML` class handles step 1 and
gives a tree of HTML *elements*. Although the actual API is different, this
tree is conceptually the same as what web browsers call *the DOM*.


Parsing CSS
...........

As with HTML, CSS stylesheets are parsed in the :class:`CSS` class
with an external library, tinycss2_.

In addition to the actual parsing, the ``css`` and ``css.validation``
modules do some pre-processing:

* Unknown and unsupported declarations are ignored with warnings.
  Remaining property values are parsed in a property-specific way
  from raw tinycss2 tokens into a higher-level form.
* Shorthand properties are expanded. For example, ``margin`` becomes
  ``margin-top``, ``margin-right``, ``margin-bottom`` and ``margin-left``.
* Hyphens in property names are replaced by underscores (``margin-top`` becomes
  ``margin_top``). This transformation is safe since none of the known (not
  ignored) properties have an underscore character.
* Selectors are pre-compiled with cssselect2_.

.. _tinycss2: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinycss2
.. _cssselect2: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cssselect2


The Cascade
...........

After that and still in the ``css`` package, the cascade_
(that’s the C in CSS!) applies the stylesheets to the element tree.
Selectors associate property declarations to elements. In case of conflicting
declarations (different values for the same property on the same element),
the one with the highest *weight* wins. Weights are based on the stylesheet’s
:ref:`origin <Stylesheet Origins>`, ``!important`` markers, selector
specificity and source order. Missing values are filled in through
*inheritance* (from the parent element) or the property’s *initial value*,
so that every element has a *specified value* for every property.

.. _cascade: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html

These *specified values* are turned into *computed values* in the
``css.computed_values`` module. Keywords and lengths in various units are
converted to pixels, etc. At this point the value for some properties can be
represented by a single number or string, but some require more complex
objects. For example, a ``Dimension`` object can be either an absolute length
or a percentage.

The final result of the ``css.get_all_computed_styles`` function is a big dict
where keys are ``(element, pseudo_element_type)`` tuples, and keys are style
dict objects. Elements are ElementTree elements, while the type of
pseudo-element is a string for eg. ``::first-line`` selectors, or :obj:`None`
for “normal” elements. Style dict objects are dicts mapping property names to
the computed values. (The return value is not the dict itself, but a
convenience ``style_for`` function for accessing it.)


Formatting Structure
....................

The `visual formatting model`_ explains how *elements* (from the ElementTree
tree) generate *boxes* (in the formatting structure). This is step 4 above.
Boxes may have children and thus form a tree, much like elements. This tree is
generally close but not identical to the ElementTree tree: some elements
generate more than one box or none.

.. _visual formatting model: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html

Boxes are of a lot of different kinds. For example you should not confuse
*block-level boxes* and *block containers*, though *block boxes* are both.  The
``formatting_structure.boxes`` module has a whole hierarchy of classes to
represent all these boxes. We won’t go into the details here, see the module
and class docstrings.

The ``formatting_structure.build`` module takes an ElementTree tree with
associated computed styles, and builds a formatting structure. It generates the
right boxes for each element and ensures they conform to the models rules
(eg. an inline box can not contain a block). Each box has a ``style``
attribute containing the style dict of computed values.

The main logic is based on the ``display`` property, but it can be overridden
for some elements by adding a handler in the ``html`` module.
This is how ``<img>`` and ``<td colspan=3>`` are currently implemented,
for example.

This module is rather short as most of HTML is defined in CSS rather than
in Python, in the `user agent stylesheet`_.

The ``formatting_structure.build.build_formatting_structure`` function returns
the box for the root element (and, through its ``children`` attribute, the
whole tree).

.. _user agent stylesheet: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/main/weasyprint/css/html5_ua.css


Layout
......

Step 5 is the layout. You could say the everything else is glue code and
this is where the magic happens.

During the layout the document’s content is, well, laid out on pages.
This is when we decide where to do line breaks and page breaks. If a break
happens inside of a box, that box is split into two (or more) boxes in the
layout result.

According to the `box model`_, each box has rectangular margin, border,
padding and content areas:

.. _box model: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html

.. image:: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/images/boxdim.png
   :alt: CSS Box Model

While ``box.style`` contains computed values, the `used values`_ are set as
attributes of the ``Box`` object itself during the layout. This include
resolving percentages and especially ``auto`` values into absolute, pixel
lengths. Once the layout done, each box has used values for margins, border
width, padding of each four sides, as well as the ``width`` and ``height`` of
the content area. They also have ``position_x`` and ``position_y``, the
absolute coordinates of the top-left corner of the margin box (**not** the
content box) from the top-left corner of the page.\ [#]_

Boxes also have helpers methods such as ``content_box_y`` and ``margin_width``
that give other metrics that can be useful in various parts of the code.

The final result of the layout is a list of ``PageBox`` objects.

.. [#] These are the coordinates *if* no `CSS transform`_ applies.
       Transforms change the actual location of boxes, but they are applied
       later during drawing and do not affect layout.
.. _used values: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#used-value
.. _CSS transform: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/


Stacking & Drawing
..................

In step 6, the boxes are reordered by the ``stacking`` module to observe
`stacking rules`_ such as the ``z-index`` property.  The result is a tree of
*stacking contexts*.

Next, each laid-out page is *drawn* onto a PDF page. Since each box has
absolute coordinates on the page from the layout step, the logic here should be
minimal. If you find yourself adding a lot of logic here, maybe it should go in
the layout or stacking instead.

The code lives in the ``draw`` module.

.. _stacking rules: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/zindex.html


Metadata
........

Finally (step 7), the ``pdf`` adds metadata to the PDF file: document
information, attachments, hyperlinks, embedded files, trim box and bleed box.
