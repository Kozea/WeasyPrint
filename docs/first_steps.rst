There are many ways to install WeasyPrint, depending on the system you use.


Linux
~~~~~

The easiest way to install WeasyPrint on Linux is to use the package manager of
your distribution. WeasyPrint is packaged for recent versions of Debian_,
Ubuntu_, Fedora_, Archlinux_, Gentoo_…

.. _Debian: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=weasyprint&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
.. _Ubuntu: https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=weasyprint&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
.. _Fedora: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/weasyprint
.. _Archlinux: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-weasyprint
.. _Gentoo: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-python/weasyprint

If WeasyPrint is not available on your distribution, or if you want to use a
more recent version of WeasyPrint, you have to be sure that Python_ (at least
version 3.7.0) and Pango_ (at least version 1.44.0) are installed on your
system. You can verify this by launching::

  python3 --version
  pango-view --version

If the version of Pango provided by your distribution is too old, you can use
version 52.5 of WeasyPrint which does not need recent Pango features.

When everything is OK, you can install WeasyPrint directly on your system or
in a `virtual environment`_ using `pip`_::

  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install weasyprint
  weasyprint --info

.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh/


Windows
~~~~~~~

Installing WeasyPrint on Windows requires to follow a few steps that may not be
easy. Please read this chapter carefully.

Only Windows 11 64-bit is supported. You can find this information in the
Control Panel → System and Security → System.

The first step is to install the latest version of Python from the `Microsoft
Store`_.

When Python is installed, you have to install GTK. Download the latest `GTK3
installer`_ and launch it. If you don’t know what some options mean, you can
safely keep the default options selected.

When everything is OK, you can launch a command prompt by clicking on the Start
menu, typing "cmd" and clicking the "Command Prompt" icon. You can then install
WeasyPrint in a `virtual environment`_ using `pip`_::

  python3 -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  python3 -m pip install weasyprint
  python3 -m weasyprint --info

.. _GTK3 installer: https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases


Other Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other solutions are available to install WeasyPrint. These solutions are not
tested but they are known to work for some use cases on specific platforms.

Macports
++++++++

On macOS, you can install WeasyPrint’s dependencies with Macports_::

  sudo port install py-pip pango libffi

You can then install WeasyPrint in a `virtual environment`_ using `pip`_::

  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install weasyprint
  weasyprint --info

.. _Macports: https://www.macports.org/

Conda
+++++

On Linux and macOS, WeasyPrint is available on Conda_, with `a WeasyPrint
package on Conda Forge`_.

.. _Conda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/
.. _a WeasyPrint package on Conda Forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/weasyprint

WSL
+++

On Windows, you can also use WSL_ and install WeasyPrint the same way it has to
be installed on Linux.

.. _WSL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/

.NET Wrapper
++++++++++++

On Windows, Bader Albarrak maintains `a .NET wrapper`_.

.. _a .NET wrapper: https://github.com/balbarak/WeasyPrint-netcore

AWS
+++

Kotify maintains `an AWS Lambda layer`_, see issue `#1003`_ for more
information.

.. _#1003: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/1003


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the installation problems have already been met, and some `issues on
GitHub`_ could help you to solve them.

Missing Library
+++++++++++++++

On Windows, most of the problems come from unreachable libraries. If you get an
error like ``cannot load library 'xxx': error xxx``, it means that WeasyPrint
can’t find this library.

You can set the ``WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES`` environment variable to list the
folders where the libraries can be found. For example, in ``cmd.exe``:

.. code-block:: doscon

    > set WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES=C:\GTK3\bin;D:\GTK3\bin

You can find more about this issue in `#589`_, `#721`_ or `#1240`_.

.. _issues on GitHub: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues
.. _#589: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/589
.. _#721: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/721
.. _#1240: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/1240

Missing Fonts
+++++++++++++

If no character is drawn in the generated PDF, or if you get squares instead of
letters, you have to install fonts and make them available to WeasyPrint.
Following the standard way to install fonts on your system should be enough.
You can also use ``@font-face`` rules to explicitly reference fonts using URLs.


Command-Line
------------

Using the WeasyPrint command line interface can be as simple as this:

.. code-block:: sh

    weasyprint https://weasyprint.org /tmp/weasyprint-website.pdf

You may see warnings on the standard error output about unsupported CSS
properties. See :ref:`Command-Line API` for the details of all available
options.

In particular, the ``-s`` option can add a filename for a
:ref:`user stylesheet <Stylesheet Origins>`. For quick experimentation
however, you may not want to create a file. In bash or zsh, you can
use the shell’s redirection instead:

.. code-block:: sh

    weasyprint https://weasyprint.org /tmp/weasyprint-website.pdf \
        -s <(echo 'body { font-family: serif !important }')

If you have many documents to convert you may prefer using the Python API
in long-lived processes to avoid paying the start-up costs every time.


Python Library
--------------

.. attention::

    Using WeasyPrint with untrusted HTML or untrusted CSS may lead to various
    :ref:`security problems <security>`.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

The Python version of the above example goes like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from weasyprint import HTML
    HTML('https://weasyprint.org/').write_pdf('/tmp/weasyprint-website.pdf')

… or with the inline stylesheet:

.. code-block:: python

    from weasyprint import HTML, CSS
    HTML('https://weasyprint.org/').write_pdf('/tmp/weasyprint-website.pdf',
        stylesheets=[CSS(string='body { font-family: serif !important }')])

Instantiating HTML and CSS Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a file name, an absolute URL or a readable :term:`file object`,
you can just pass it to :class:`HTML` or :class:`CSS` to create an instance.
Alternatively, use a named argument so that no guessing is involved:

.. code-block:: python

    from weasyprint import HTML

    HTML('../foo.html')  # Same as …
    HTML(filename='../foo.html')

    HTML('https://weasyprint.org')  # Same as …
    HTML(url='https://weasyprint.org')

    HTML(sys.stdin)  # Same as …
    HTML(file_obj=sys.stdin)

If you have a byte string or Unicode string already in memory you can also pass
that, although the argument must be named:

.. code-block:: python

    from weasyprint import HTML, CSS

    # HTML('<h1>foo') would be filename
    HTML(string='''
        <h1>The title</h1>
        <p>Content goes here
    ''')
    CSS(string='@page { size: A3; margin: 1cm }')

If you have ``@font-face`` rules in your CSS, you have to create a
``FontConfiguration`` object:

.. code-block:: python

    from weasyprint import HTML, CSS
    from weasyprint.text.fonts import FontConfiguration

    font_config = FontConfiguration()
    html = HTML(string='<h1>The title</h1>')
    css = CSS(string='''
        @font-face {
            font-family: Gentium;
            src: url(https://example.com/fonts/Gentium.otf);
        }
        h1 { font-family: Gentium }''', font_config=font_config)
    html.write_pdf(
        '/tmp/example.pdf', stylesheets=[css],
        font_config=font_config)

Rendering to a Single File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have a :class:`HTML` object, call its :meth:`HTML.write_pdf` method to
get the rendered document in a single PDF file.

Without arguments, this method returns a byte string in memory. If you pass a
file name or a writable :term:`file object`, they will write there directly
instead. (**Warning**: with a filename, these methods will overwrite existing
files silently.)

Individual Pages & Meta-Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want more than a single PDF, the :meth:`HTML.render` method gives you a
:class:`document.Document` object with access to individual
:class:`document.Page` objects. Thus you can get the number of pages, their
size\ [#]_, the details of hyperlinks and bookmarks, etc. Documents also have a
:meth:`document.Document.write_pdf` method, and you can get a subset of the
pages with :meth:`document.Document.copy()`.  Finally, for ultimate control,
:meth:`document.Page.paint` individual pages anywhere on any
:class:`pydyf.Stream`.

.. [#] Pages in the same document do not always have the same size.

See the :ref:`Python API` for details. A few random examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # Write odd and even pages separately:
    #   Lists count from 0 but page numbers usually from 1
    #   [::2] is a slice of even list indexes but odd-numbered pages.
    document.copy(document.pages[::2]).write_pdf('odd_pages.pdf')
    document.copy(document.pages[1::2]).write_pdf('even_pages.pdf')

.. code-block:: python

    # Print the outline of the document.
    # Output on https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html
    #     1. Introduction to CSS 2.1 (page 2)
    #       1. A brief CSS 2.1 tutorial for HTML (page 2)
    #       2. A brief CSS 2.1 tutorial for XML (page 5)
    #       3. The CSS 2.1 processing model (page 6)
    #         1. The canvas (page 7)
    #         2. CSS 2.1 addressing model (page 7)
    #       4. CSS design principles (page 8)
    def print_outline(bookmarks, indent=0):
        for i, bookmark in enumerate(bookmarks, 1):
            page = bookmark.destination[0]
            print('%s%d. %s (page %d)' % (
                ' ' * indent, i, bookmark.label.lstrip('0123456789. '), page))
            print_outline(bookmark.children, indent + 2)
    print_outline(document.make_bookmark_tree())

URL Fetchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint goes through a *URL fetcher* to fetch external resources such as
images or CSS stylesheets. The default fetcher can natively open file and
HTTP URLs, but the HTTP client does not support advanced features like cookies
or authentication. This can be worked-around by passing a custom
``url_fetcher`` callable to the :class:`HTML` or :class:`CSS` classes.
It must have the same signature as :func:`default_url_fetcher`.

Custom fetchers can choose to handle some URLs and defer others
to the default fetcher:

.. code-block:: python

    from weasyprint import default_url_fetcher, HTML

    def my_fetcher(url):
        if url.startswith('graph:'):
            graph_data = map(float, url[6:].split(','))
            string = generate_graph(graph_data)
            return {'string': string, 'mime_type': 'image/png'}
        return default_url_fetcher(url)

    source = '<img src="graph:42,10.3,87">'
    HTML(string=source, url_fetcher=my_fetcher).write_pdf('out.pdf')

Flask-WeasyPrint_ for Flask_ and Django-Weasyprint_ for Django_ both make
use of a custom URL fetcher to integrate WeasyPrint and use the filesystem
instead of a network call for static and media files.

A custom fetcher should be returning a :obj:`dict` with

* One of ``string`` (a :obj:`bytestring <bytes>`) or ``file_obj`` (a
  :term:`file object`).
* Optionally: ``mime_type``, a MIME type extracted e.g. from a *Content-Type*
  header. If not provided, the type is guessed from the file extension in the
  URL.
* Optionally: ``encoding``, a character encoding extracted e.g. from a
  *charset* parameter in a *Content-Type* header
* Optionally: ``redirected_url``, the actual URL of the resource if there were
  e.g. HTTP redirects.
* Optionally: ``filename``, the filename of the resource. Usually derived from
  the *filename* parameter in a *Content-Disposition* header

If a ``file_obj`` is given, the resource will be closed automatically by
the function internally used by WeasyPrint to retrieve data.

Image Cache and Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint provides many options to deal with images: ``optimize_images``,
``jpeg_quality``, ``dpi`` and ``image_cache``.

``optimize_images`` can enable size optimization for images. When enabled, the
generated PDF will include smaller images with no quality penalty, but the
rendering time may be slightly increased.

The ``jpeg_quality`` option can be set to decrease the quality of JPEG images
included in the PDF. You can set a value between 95 (best quality) to 0
(smaller image size), depending on your needs.

The ``dpi`` option offers the possibility to reduce the size (in pixels, and
thus in bytes) of all included raster images. The resolution, set in dots per
inch, indicates the maximum number of pixels included in one inch on the
generated PDF.

.. code-block:: python

    # Original high-quality images, faster, but generated PDF is larger
    HTML('https://weasyprint.org/').write_pdf('weasyprint.pdf')

    # Optimized lower-quality images, a bit slower, but generated PDF is smaller
    HTML('https://weasyprint.org/').write_pdf(
        'weasyprint.pdf', optimize_images=True, jpeg_quality=60, dpi=150)

``image_cache`` gives the possibility to use a cache for images, avoiding to
download, parse and optimize them each time they are used.

By default, the cache is used document by document, but you can share it
between documents if needed. This feature can save a lot of network and CPU
time when you render a lot of documents that use the same images.

.. code-block:: python

    cache = {}
    for i in range(10):
        HTML(f'https://weasyprint.org/').write_pdf(
            f'example-{i}.pdf', image_cache=cache)

It’s also possible to cache images on disk instead of keeping them in memory.
The ``--cache-folder`` CLI option can be used to define the folder used to
store temporary images. You can also provide this folder path as a string for
``image_cache``.


Logging
~~~~~~~

Most errors (unsupported CSS property, missing image, ...)
are not fatal and will not prevent a document from being rendered.

WeasyPrint uses the :mod:`logging` module from the Python standard library to
log these errors and let you know about them. When WeasyPrint is launched in a
terminal, logged messaged will go to *stderr* by default. You can change that
by configuring the ``weasyprint`` logger object:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger('weasyprint')
    logger.addHandler(logging.FileHandler('/path/to/weasyprint.log'))

The ``weasyprint.progress`` logger is used to report the rendering progress. It
is useful to get feedback when WeasyPrint is launched in a terminal (using the
``--verbose`` or ``--debug`` option), or to give this feedback to end users
when used as a library.

See the documentation of the :mod:`logging` module for details.


Security
--------

When used with untrusted HTML or untrusted CSS, WeasyPrint can meet security
problems. You will need extra configuration in your Python application to avoid
high memory use, endless renderings or local files leaks.

*This section has been added thanks to the very useful reports and advice from
Raz Becker.*

Long Renderings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint is pretty slow and can take a long time to render long documents or
specially crafted HTML pages.

When WeasyPrint used on a server with HTML or CSS files from untrusted sources,
this problem can lead to very long time renderings, with processes with high
CPU and memory use. Even small documents may lead to really long rendering
times, restricting HTML document size is not enough.

If you use WeasyPrint on a server with HTML or CSS samples coming from
untrusted users, you should:

- limit rendering time and memory use of your process, for example using
  ``evil-reload-on-as`` and ``harakiri`` options if you use uWSGI,
- limit memory use at the OS level, for example with ``ulimit`` on Linux,
- automatically kill the process when it uses too much memory or when the
  rendering time is too high, by regularly launching a script to do so if no
  better option is available,
- truncate and sanitize HTML and CSS input to avoid very long documents and
  access to external URLs.

Infinite Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint can reach files on the network, for example using ``https://``
URIs. For various reasons, HTTP requests may take a long time and lead to
problems similar to :ref:`Long Renderings`.

WeasyPrint has a default timeout of 10 seconds for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP
resources. This timeout has no effect with other protocols, including access to
``file://`` URIs.

If you use WeasyPrint on a server with HTML or CSS samples coming from
untrusted users, or need to reach network resources, you should:

- use a custom :ref:`URL fetcher <URL Fetchers>`,
- follow solutions listed in :ref:`Long Renderings`.

Infinite Loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint has been hit by a large number of bugs, including infinite
loops. Specially crafted HTML and CSS files can quite easily lead to infinite
loops and infinite rendering times.

If you use WeasyPrint on a server with HTML or CSS samples coming from
untrusted users, you should:

- follow solutions listed in :ref:`Long Renderings`.

Huge Values
~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint doesn't restrict integer and float values used in CSS. Using huge
values for some properties (page sizes, font sizes, block sizes) can lead to
various problems, including infinite rendering times, huge PDF files, high
memory use and crashes.

This problem is really hard to avoid. Even parsing CSS stylesheets and
searching for huge values is not enough, as it is quite easy to trick CSS
pre-processors using relative units (``em`` and ``%`` for example).

If you use WeasyPrint on a server with HTML or CSS samples coming from
untrusted users, you should:

- follow solutions listed in :ref:`Long Renderings`.

Access to Local Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As any web renderer, WeasyPrint can reach files on the local filesystem using
``file://`` URIs. These files can be shown in ``img`` or ``embed`` tags for
example.

When WeasyPrint used on a server with HTML or CSS files from untrusted sources,
this feature may be used to know if files are present on the server filesystem,
and to embed them in generated documents.

Unix-like systems also have special local files with infinite size, like
``/dev/urandom``. Referencing these files in HTML or CSS files obviously lead
to infinite time renderings.

If you use WeasyPrint on a server with HTML or CSS samples coming from
untrusted users, you should:

- restrict your process access to trusted files using sandboxing solutions,
- use a custom :ref:`URL fetcher <URL Fetchers>` that doesn't allow ``file://``
  URLs or filters access depending on given paths.
- follow solutions listed in :ref:`Long Renderings`.

System Information Leaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WeasyPrint relies on many libraries that can leak hardware and software
information. Even when this information looks useless, it can be used by
attackers to exploit other security breaches.

Leaks can include (but are not restricted to):

- locally installed fonts (using ``font-family`` and ``@font-face``),
- network configuration (IPv4 and IPv6 support, IP addressing, firewall
  configuration, using ``https://`` URIs and tracking time used to render
  documents),
- Python, Pango and other libraries versions (implementation details
  lead to different renderings).

SVG Images
~~~~~~~~~~

Rendering SVG images more or less suffers from the same problems as the ones
listed here for WeasyPrint.

Security advices apply for untrusted SVG files as they apply for untrusted HTML
and CSS documents.

Note that WeasyPrint’s URL fetcher is used to render SVG files.
