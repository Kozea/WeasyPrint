API Reference
=============

.. currentmodule:: weasyprint


This page is for WeasyPrint |version|. See :doc:`changelog </changelog>` for
older versions.


API Stability
-------------

Everything described here is considered “public”: this is what you can rely
on. We will try to maintain backward-compatibility, and we really often do, but
there is no hard promise.

Anything else should not be used outside of WeasyPrint itself. We reserve
the right to change it or remove it at any point. Use it at your own risk,
or have dependency to a specific WeasyPrint version.


Versioning
----------

WeasyPrint provides frequent major releases, and minor releases with only bug
fixes. Versioning is close to what many browsers do, including Firefox and
Chrome: big major numbers, small minor numbers.

Even if each version does not break the API, each version does break the way
documents are rendered, which is what really matters at the end. Providing
minor versions would give the illusion that developers can just update
WeasyPrint without checking that everything works.

Unfortunately, we have the same problem as the other browsers: when a new
version is released, most of the user's websites are rendered exactly the same,
but a small part is not. And the only ways to know that, for web developers,
are to read the changelog and to check that their pages are correctly rendered.

More about this choice can be found in
issue `#900`_.

Supported Features
------------------


URLs
~~~~

WeasyPrint can read normal files, HTTP, FTP and `data URIs`_. It will follow
HTTP redirects but more advanced features like cookies and authentication
are currently not supported, although a custom :ref:`URL fetcher
<URL Fetchers>` can help.

.. _data URIs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme


HTML
~~~~

Supported HTML Tags
+++++++++++++++++++

Many HTML elements are implemented in CSS through the HTML5
`User-Agent stylesheet`_.

Some elements need special treatment:

* The ``<base>`` element, if present, determines the base for relative URLs.
* CSS stylesheets can be embedded in ``<style>`` elements or linked by
  ``<link rel=stylesheet>`` elements.
* ``<img>``, ``<embed>`` or ``<object>`` elements accept images either
  in raster formats supported by Pillow_ (including PNG, JPEG, GIF, ...)
  or in SVG. SVG images are not rasterized but rendered
  as vectors in the PDF output.

HTML `presentational hints`_ are not supported by default, but most of them can
be supported:

* by using the ``--presentational-hints`` CLI parameter, or
* by setting the ``presentational_hints`` parameter of the ``HTML.render`` or
  ``HTML.write_*`` methods to ``True``.

Presentational hints include a wide array of attributes that direct styling in
HTML, including font ``color`` and ``size``, list attributes like ``type`` and
``start``, various table alignment attributes, and others. If the document
generated by WeasyPrint is missing some of the features you expect from the
HTML, try to enable this option.

.. _User-Agent stylesheet: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/weasyprint/css/html5_ua.css
.. _presentational hints: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/rendering.html#presentational-hints
.. _Pillow: https://python-pillow.org/

Stylesheet Origins
++++++++++++++++++

HTML documents are rendered with stylesheets from three *origins*:

* The HTML5 `user agent stylesheet`_ (defines the default appearance
  of HTML elements);
* Author stylesheets embedded in the document in ``<style>`` elements
  or linked by ``<link rel=stylesheet>`` elements;
* User stylesheets provided in the API.

Keep in mind that *user* stylesheets have a lower priority than *author*
stylesheets in the cascade_, unless you use `!important`_ in declarations
to raise their priority.

.. _user agent stylesheet: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/weasyprint/css/html5_ua.css
.. _cascade: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascading-order
.. _!important: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#important-rules


PDF
~~~

In addition to text, raster and vector graphics, WeasyPrint’s PDF files
can contain hyperlinks, bookmarks and attachments.

Hyperlinks will be clickable in PDF viewers that support them. They can
be either internal, to another part of the same document (eg.
``<a href="#pdf">``) or external, to an URL. External links are resolved
to absolute URLs: ``<a href="/news/">`` on the WeasyPrint website would always
point to http://weasyprint.org/news/ in PDF files.

PDF bookmarks are also called outlines and are generally shown in a
sidebar. Clicking on an entry scrolls the matching part of the document
into view. By default all ``<h1>`` to ``<h6>`` titles generate bookmarks,
but this can be controlled with `PDF bookmarks`_.)

Attachments are related files, embedded in the PDF itself. They can be
specified through ``<link rel=attachment>`` elements to add resources globally
or through regular links with ``<a rel=attachment>`` to attach a resource that
can be saved by clicking on said link. The ``title`` attribute can be used as
description of the attachment.


Fonts
~~~~~

WeasyPrint can use any font that Pango can find installed on the system. Fonts
are automatically embedded in PDF files.

Pango always uses fontconfig to access fonts, even on Windows and macOS. You
can list the available fonts thanks to the ``fc-list`` command, and know which
font is matched by a given pattern thanks to ``fc-match``. Copying a font file
into the ``~/.local/share/fonts`` or ``~/.fonts`` directory is generally enough
to install a new font. WeasyPrint should support `any font format handled by
FreeType`_.

.. _any font format handled by FreeType: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeType#File_formats


CSS
~~~

WeasyPrint supports many of the `CSS specifications`_ written by the W3C. You
will find in this chapter a comprehensive list of the specifications or drafts
with at least one feature implemented in WeasyPrint.

The results of some of the test suites provided by the W3C are also available
at `test.weasyprint.org`_. This website uses a tool called `WeasySuite`_ that
can be useful if you want to implement new features in WeasyPrint.

.. _CSS specifications: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work

.. _WeasySuite: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasySuite

CSS Level 2 Revision 1
++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Level 2 Revision 1`_ specification, best known as CSS 2.1, is pretty
well supported by WeasyPrint. Since version 0.11, it passes the famous `Acid2
Test`_.

The CSS 2.1 features listed here are **not** supported:

* The `::first-line`_ pseudo-element.
* On tables: `visibility: collapse`_.
* Minimum and maximum height_ on table-related boxes.
* Minimum and maximum width_ and height_ on page-margin boxes.
* Conforming `font matching algorithm`_. Currently ``font-family``
  is passed as-is to Pango.
* Right-to-left or `bi-directional text`_.
* `System colors`_ and `system fonts`_. The former are deprecated in `CSS Color
  Module Level 3`_.

.. _CSS Level 2 Revision 1: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/

To the best of our knowledge, everything else that applies to the
print media **is** supported. Please report a bug if you find this list
incomplete.

Selectors Level 3
+++++++++++++++++

With the exceptions noted here, all `Selectors Level 3`_ are supported.

PDF is generally not interactive. The ``:hover``, ``:active``, ``:focus``,
``:target`` and ``:visited`` pseudo-classes are accepted as valid but
never match anything.

.. _Selectors Level 3: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/

CSS Text Module Level 3 / 4
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Text Module Level 3`_ and `CSS Text Module Level 4`_ are working
drafts defining "properties for text manipulation" and covering "line breaking,
justification and alignment, white space handling, and text transformation".

Among their features, some are already included in CSS 2.1, sometimes with
missing or different values (``text-indent``, ``text-align``,
``letter-spacing``, ``word-spacing``, ``text-transform``, ``white-space``).

New properties defined in Level 3 are supported:

- the ``overflow-wrap`` property replacing ``word-wrap``;
- the ``full-width`` value of the ``text-transform`` property; and
- the ``tab-size`` property.

Experimental_ properties controling hyphenation_ are supported by WeasyPrint:

- ``hyphens``,
- ``hyphenate-character``,
- ``hyphenate-limit-chars``, and
- ``hyphenate-limit-zone``.

To get automatic hyphenation, you to set it to ``auto``
*and* have the ``lang`` HTML attribute set to one of the languages
`supported by Pyphen`_.

.. code-block:: html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang=en>
    <style>
      html { hyphens: auto }
    </style>
    …

Automatic hyphenation can be disabled again with the ``manual`` value:

.. code-block:: css

    html { hyphens: auto }
    a[href]::after { content: ' [' attr(href) ']'; hyphens: manual }

The other features provided by `CSS Text Module Level 3`_ are **not**
supported:

- the ``line-break`` and ``word-break`` properties;
- the ``start``, ``end``, ``match-parent`` and ``start end`` values of the
  ``text-align`` property;
- the ``text-align-last`` and ``text-justify`` properties; and
- the ``text-indent`` and ``hanging-punctuation`` properties.

The other features provided by `CSS Text Module Level 4`_ are **not**
supported:

- the ``text-space-collapse`` and ``text-space-trim`` properties;
- the ``text-wrap``, ``wrap-before``, ``wrap-after`` and ``wrap-inside``
  properties;
- the ``text-align`` property with an alignment character;
- the ``pre-wrap-auto`` value of the ``white-space`` property; and
- the ``text-spacing`` property.

CSS Fonts Module Level 3
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Fonts Module Level 3`_ is a candidate recommendation describing "how
font properties are specified and how font resources are loaded dynamically".

WeasyPrint supports the ``font-size``, ``font-stretch``, ``font-style`` and
``font-weight`` properties, coming from CSS 2.1.

WeasyPrint also supports the following font features added in Level 3:
- ``font-kerning``,
- ``font-variant-ligatures``,
- ``font-variant-position``,
- ``font-variant-caps``,
- ``font-variant-numeric``,
- ``font-variant-east-asian``,
- ``font-feature-settings``, and
- ``font-language-override``.

``font-family`` is supported. The string is given to Pango that tries to find a
matching font in a way different from what is defined in the recommendation,
but that should not be a problem for common use.

The shorthand ``font`` and ``font-variant`` properties are supported.

WeasyPrint supports the ``@font-face`` rule, provided that Pango >= 1.38 is installed.

WeasyPrint does **not** support the ``@font-feature-values`` rule and the
values of ``font-variant-alternates`` other than ``normal`` and
``historical-forms``.

The ``font-variant-caps`` property is supported but needs the small-caps variant of
the font to be installed. WeasyPrint does **not** simulate missing small-caps
fonts.

CSS Paged Media Module Level 3
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Paged Media Module Level 3`_ is a working draft including features for
paged media "describing how:

- page breaks are created and avoided;
- the page properties such as size, orientation, margins, border, and padding
  are specified;
- headers and footers are established within the page margins;
- content such as page counters are placed in the headers and footers; and
- orphans and widows can be controlled."

All the features of this draft are available, including:

- the ``@page`` rule and the ``:left``, ``:right``, ``:first`` and ``:blank``
  selectors;
- the page margin boxes;
- the page-based counters (with known limitations  `#93`_);
- the page ``size``, ``bleed`` and ``marks`` properties;
- the named pages.

.. _CSS Paged Media Module Level 3: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-page/
.. _#93: https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/93

CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module`_ (GCPM) is a working draft
defining "new properties and values, so that authors may bring new techniques
(running headers and footers, footnotes, page selection) to paged media".

`Page selectors`_ are supported by WeasyPrint. You can select pages according
to their position in the document:

.. code-block:: css

    @page :nth(3) { background: red } /* Third page */
    @page :nth(2n+1) { background: green } /* Odd pages */

You can also use `running elements`_ to put HTML boxes into the page margins
(but the ``start`` parameter of ``element()`` is not supported).

The other features of GCPM are **not** implemented:

- footnotes (``float: footnote``, ``footnote-display``, ``footnote`` counter,
  ``::footnote-call``, ``::footnote-marker``, ``@footnote`` rule,
  ``footnote-policy``);
- page groups (``:nth(X of pagename)`` pseudo-class).

.. _CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module: http://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/
.. _Page selectors: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/#document-page-selectors
.. _running elements: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/#running-elements

CSS Generated Content Module Level 3
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Generated Content Module Level 3`_ is a working draft helping "authors
[who] sometimes want user agents to render content that does not come from the
document tree. One familiar example of this is numbered headings
[…]. Similarly, authors may want the user agent to insert the word "Figure"
before the caption of a figure […], or replacing elements with images or other
multimedia content."

`Named strings`_ are supported by WeasyPrint. You can define strings related to
the first or last element of a type present on a page, and display these
strings in page borders. This feature is really useful to add the title of the
current chapter at the top of the pages of a book for example.

The named strings can embed static strings, counters, cross-references, tag
contents and tag attributes.

.. code-block:: css

    @top-center { content: string(chapter) }
    h2 { string-set: chapter "Current chapter: " content() }

`Cross-references`_ retrieve counter or content values from targets (anchors or
identifiers) in the current document:

.. code-block:: css

    a::after { content: ", on page " target-counter(attr(href), page) }
    a::after { content: ", see " target-text(attr(href)) }

In particular, ``target-counter()`` and ``target-text()`` are useful when it
comes to tables of contents (see `an example`_).

You can also control `PDF bookmarks`_ with WeasyPrint. Using the experimental_
``bookmark-level``, ``bookmark-label`` and ``bookmark-state`` properties, you
can add bookmarks that will be available in your PDF reader.

Bookmarks have already been added in the WeasyPrint's `user agent stylesheet`_,
so your generated documents will automatically have bookmarks on headers (from
``<h1>`` to ``<h6>``). But for example, if you have only one top-level ``<h1>``
and do not wish to include it in the bookmarks, add this in your stylesheet:

.. code-block:: css

    h1 { bookmark-level: none }

The other features of this module are **not** implemented:

- quotes (``content: *-quote``);
- leaders (``content: leader()``).

CSS Color Module Level 3
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Color Module Level 3`_ is a recommendation defining "CSS properties
which allow authors to specify the foreground color and opacity of an
element". Its main goal is to specify how colors are defined, including color
keywords and the ``#rgb``, ``#rrggbb``, ``rgb()``, ``rgba()``, ``hsl()``,
``hsla()`` syntaxes. Opacity and alpha compositing are also defined in this
document.

This recommendation is fully implemented in WeasyPrint, except the deprecated
System Colors.

.. _CSS Color Module Level 3: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/

CSS Transforms Module Level 1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Transforms Module Level 1`_ working draft "describes a coordinate
system within each element is positioned. This coordinate space can be modified
with the transform property. Using transform, elements can be translated,
rotated and scaled in two or three dimensional space."

WeasyPrint supports the ``transform`` and ``transform-origin`` properties, and
all the 2D transformations (``matrix``, ``rotate``, ``translate(X|Y)?``,
``scale(X|Y)?``, ``skew(X|Y)?``).

WeasyPrint does **not** support the ``transform-style``, ``perspective``,
``perspective-origin`` and ``backface-visibility`` properties, and all the 3D
transformations (``matrix3d``, ``rotate(3d|X|Y|Z)``, ``translate(3d|Z)``,
``scale(3d|Z)``).

.. _CSS Transforms Module Level 1: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-transforms/

CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3`_ is a candidate recommendation
defining properties dealing "with the decoration of the border area and with
the background of the content, padding and border areas".

The `border part`_ of this module is supported, as it is already included in
the the CSS 2.1 specification.

WeasyPrint supports the `background part`_ of this module (allowing multiple
background layers per box), including the ``background``, ``background-color``,
``background-image``, ``background-repeat``, ``background-attachment``,
``background-position``, ``background-clip``, ``background-origin`` and
``background-size`` properties.

WeasyPrint also supports the `rounded corners part`_ of this module, including
the ``border-radius`` property.

WeasyPrint does **not** support the `border images part`_ of this module,
including the ``border-image``, ``border-image-source``,
``border-image-slice``, ``border-image-width``, ``border-image-outset`` and
``border-image-repeat`` properties.

WeasyPrint does **not** support the `box shadow part`_ of this module,
including the ``box-shadow`` property. This feature has been implemented in a
`git branch`_ that is not released, as it relies on raster implementation of
shadows.

CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 3 / 4
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 3`_ is a candidate
recommendation introducing "additional ways of representing 2D images, for
example as a list of URIs denoting fallbacks, or as a gradient", defining
"several properties for manipulating raster images and for sizing or
positioning replaced elements" and "generic sizing algorithm for replaced
elements".

The `Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 4`_ is a working draft on
the same subject.

The ``linear-gradient()``, ``radial-gradient()`` and
``repeating-radial-gradient()`` properties are supported as background images.

The the ``url()`` notation is supported, but the ``image()`` notation is
**not** supported for background images.

The ``object-fit`` and ``object-position`` properties are supported.

.. _Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 4: http://www.w3.org/TR/css4-images/

CSS Box Sizing Module Level 3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Box Sizing Module Level 3`_ is a candidate recommendation extending
"the CSS sizing properties with keywords that represent content-based
'intrinsic' sizes and context-based 'extrinsic' sizes."

The new property defined in this document is implemented in WeasyPrint:
``box-sizing``.

The ``min-content``, ``max-content`` and ``fit-content()`` sizing values are
**not** supported.

.. _CSS Box Sizing Module Level 3: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/

CSS Overflow Module Level 3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

of CSS relating to scrollable overflow handling in visual media."

The ``overflow`` property is supported, as defined in CSS2. ``overflow-x``,
``overflow-y``, ``overflow-clip-margin``, ``overflow-inline`` and
``overflow-block`` are **not** supported.

The ``text-overflow``, ``block-ellipsis``, ``line-clamp``, ``max-lines`` and
``continue`` properties are supported.

**not** supported.

The ``column-span`` property is supported for direct children of columns.

The ``column-fill`` property is supported, with a column balancing algorithm
that should be efficient with simple cases.

.. _CSS Multi-column Layout Module: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/

CSS Fragmentation Module Level 3 / 4
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `CSS Fragmentation Module Level 3`_ "describes the fragmentation model that
partitions a flow into pages, columns, or regions. It builds on the Page model
module and introduces and defines the fragmentation model. It adds
functionality for pagination, breaking variable fragment size and orientation,
widows and orphans."

The `CSS Fragmentation Module Level 4`_ is a working draft on the same subject.

The ``break-before``, ``break-after`` and ``break-inside`` properties are
supported for pages, but **not** for columns and regions. ``page-break-*``
aliases as defined in CSS2 are supported too.

The ``orphans`` and ``widows`` properties are supported.

The ``box-decoration-break`` property is supported, but backgrounds are always
repeated and not extended through the whole box as it should be with 'slice'
