    Resolve images’ auto width from non-auto height and intrinsic ratio.
  * Fix `#21 <https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/21>`_:
    The ``data:`` URL scheme is case-insensitive.

------------

Released on 2013-02-27.

* Added `text hyphenation`_ with the ``-weasy-hyphens`` property.
* When a document includes JPEG images, embed them as JPEG in the PDF output.
  This often results in smaller PDF file size
  compared to the default *deflate* compression.
* Switched to using CFFI instead of PyGTK or PyGObject-introspection.
* Layout bug fixes:

  - Correctly trim whitespace at the end of lines.
  - Fix some cases with floats within inline content.

.. _text hyphenation: https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#css-text-module-level-3-4


Version 0.16
------------

Released on 2012-12-13.

* Add the ``zoom`` parameter to ``HTML.write_pdf`` and
  ``Document.write_pdf() <weasyprint.document.Document.write_pdf>``
* Fix compatibility with old (and buggy) pycairo versions.
  WeasyPrint is now tested on 1.8.8 in addition to the latest.
* Fix layout bugs related to line trailing spaces.


Version 0.15
------------

Released on 2012-10-09.

* Add a low-level API that enables painting pages individually on any
  cairo surface.
* **Backward-incompatible change**: remove the ``HTML.get_png_pages``
  method. The new low-level API covers this functionality and more.
* Add support for the ``font-stretch`` property.
* Add support for ``@page:blank`` to select blank pages.
* New Sphinx-based and improved docs
* Bug fixes:

  - Importing Pango in some PyGTK installations.
  - Layout of inline-blocks with `vertical-align: top` or `bottom`.
  - Do not repeat a block’s margin-top or padding-top after a page break.
  - Performance problem with large tables split across many pages.
  - Anchors and hyperlinks areas now follow CSS transforms.
    Since PDF links have to be axis-aligned rectangles, the bounding box
    is used. This may be larger than expected with rotations that are
    not a multiple of 90 degrees.


Version 0.14
------------

Released on 2012-08-03.

* Add a public API to choose media type used for @media.
  (It still defaults to ``print``). Thanks Chung Lu!
* Add ``--base-url`` and ``--resolution`` to the command-line API, making it
  as complete as the Python one.
* Add support for the ``<base href="...">`` element in HTML.
* Add support for CSS outlines
* Switch to gdk-pixbuf instead of Pystacia for loading raster images.
* Bug fixes:

  - Handling of filenames and URLs on Windows
  - Unicode filenames with older version of py2cairo
  - ``base_url`` now behaves as expected when set to a directory name.
  - Make some tests more robust


Version 0.13
------------

Released on 2012-07-23.

* Add support for PyGTK, as an alternative to PyGObject + introspection.
  This should make WeasyPrint easier to run on platforms that not not have
  packages for PyGObject 3.x yet.
* Bug fix: crash in PDF outlines for some malformed HTML documents


Version 0.12
------------

Released on 2012-07-19.

* Add support for collapsed borders on tables. This is currently incompatible
  with repeating header and footer row groups on each page: headers and footers
  are treated as normal row groups on table with ``border-collapse: collapse``.
* Add ``url_fetcher`` to the public API. This enables users to hook into
  WeasyPrint for fetching linked stylesheets or images, eg. to generate them
  on the fly without going through the network.
  This enables the creation of `Flask-WeasyPrint
  <http://packages.python.org/Flask-WeasyPrint/>`_.


Version 0.11
------------

Released on 2012-07-04.

* Add support for floats and clear.
  Together with various bug fixes, this enables WeasyPrint to pass the Acid2
  test! Acid2 is now part of our automated test suite.
* Add support for the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height and
  max-height properties in @page. The size property is now the size of the
  page’s containing block.
* Switch the Variable Dimension rules to `the new proposal
  <https://github.com/SimonSapin/css/blob/master/margin-boxes-variable-dimension>`_.
  The previous implementation was broken in many cases.
* The ``image-rendering``, ``transform``, ``transform-origin`` and ``size``
  properties are now unprefixed. The prefixed form (eg. -weasy-size) is ignored
  but gives a specific warning.


Version 0.10
------------

Released on 2012-06-25.

* Add ``get_png_pages()`` to the public API. It returns each page as
  a separate PNG image.

* *Backward incompatible*: completely change the Python API. See the
  documentation:
  https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#as-a-python-library

  (their maximum is used) instead of accumulating.

* Add compatibility with CPython 2.6 and 3.2. (Previously only 2.7
  was supported)

-----------

Released on 2012-02-08.

* Support for the ``overflow`` and ``clip`` properties.
* Support for the ``opacity`` property from CSS3 Colors.
* Support for CSS 2D Transforms. These are prefixed, so you need to use
  ``-weasy-transform`` and ``-weasy-transform-origin``.


Version 0.4

Released on 2012-02-07.

* Support ``text-align: justify``, ``word-spacing`` and ``letter-spacing``.

  page-based counters.

Compatibility with CairoSVG 0.1.2


Version 0.3
-----------

Released on 2011-12-13.

  it is in an experimental specification). Use '-weasy-size' instead.
* cssutils 0.9.8 or higher is now required.
* Support SVG images with CairoSVG
* Support generated content: the ``:before`` and ``:after`` pseudo-elements,
  the ``content``, ``quotes`` and ``counter-*`` properties.
* Support ordered lists: all CSS 2.1 values of the ``list-style-type`` property.
* New user-agent stylesheet with HTML 5 elements and automatic quotes for many

than a page will overflow.

First packaged release. Supports "simple" CSS 2.1 pages: there is no
support for floats, tables, or absolute positioning. Other than that
