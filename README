WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS that can export
to PDF. It aims to support web standards for printing.
WeasyPrint is free software made available under the `BSD license
<https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.

It is based on various libraries **not** on a full rendering engine like
WebKit on Gecko. The CSS layout engine is written in Python and meant to be
easy to hack on.
